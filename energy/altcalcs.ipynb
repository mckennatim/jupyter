    "\n",
    "The Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) is a metric that measures the energy efficiency of a heat pump over an entire heating season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the COP, which provides a snapshot of the heat pump’s efficiency at a specific moment, SCOP takes into account the varying outdoor temperatures and operating conditions throughout the season, giving a more comprehensive picture of the heat pump’s overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, below is a simplified example to help you understand the concept of SCOP calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a heat pump and we want to calculate its SCOP based on the following three temperature ranges during the heating season:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Temperature range A: -10°C to 0°C\n",
    "    Temperature range B: 0°C to 10°C\n",
    "    Temperature range C: 10°C to 20°C\n",
    " We also have the heat pump’s COP at the average temperature for each range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    COP at -5°C (average of range A): 2.0\n",
    "    COP at 5°C (average of range B): 3.0\n",
    "    COP at 15°C (average of range C): 4.0\n",
    " \n",
    "Additionally, we need to know the percentage of the heating season the heat pump operates within each temperature range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Percentage of time in range A: 20%\n",
    "    Percentage of time in range B: 50%\n",
    "    Percentage of time in range C: 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the SCOP, we’ll multiply the COP at each temperature range by the percentage of time the heat pump operates in that range and sum the results:\n",

    "SCOP = (COP at -5°C x percentage of time in range A) + (COP at 5°C x percentage of time in range B) + (COP at 15°C x percentage of time in range C)\n",
    "\n",

    "from [Energy Vanguard - Allison Bailes](https://www.energyvanguard.com/blog/can-you-oversize-a-mini-split-heat-pump/ )\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding turndown\n",
    "For example, the Mitsubishi FS06 wall-mounted ductless unit has a rated cooling capacity of 6,000 BTU per hour and goes down to a minimum capacity of 1,700 BTU per hour.  That’s a turndown percentage of 28% (1,700 ÷ 6,000).  If you put that unit in a room with a load of 1,500 BTU per hour, it will bottom out nearly 100% of the time it’s running in cooling mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you’ll see turndown ratio, which is the same concept as turndown percentage but upside down.  It’s the ratio of maximum to minimum capacity.  For the example here, it would be 6,000 ÷ 1,700 = 3.5.  So the turndown ratio is 3.5 to 1, sometimes written 3.5:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens at part-load?\n",
    "One of the great advantages of using mini-splits is their variable capacity.  By oversizing them, you can lose that advantage completely.  That 6,000 BTU per hour mini-split in a room with 1,500 BTU per hour of cooling load doesn’t act at all like it has variable capacity because it’s always running at the lowest capacity except on the really extreme temperature days.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the bottom end of the capacity range is at or above the heating or cooling load, there’s no benefit in part-load conditions.  As the heating or cooling load drops from the design load, you want a system whose capacity also drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "That 6,000 BTU/hr system with a bottom end of 1,700 BTU/hr serving a load of 1,500 BTU/hr doesn’t vary at all in part-load conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the load is 1,500 BTU/hr (the design load), the system will give you 1,700 BTU/hr.  When the load drops to 1,000 BTU/hr, the system will give you 1,700 BTU/hr.  When the load is only 500 BTU/hr, the system will give you 1,700 BTU/hr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, oversizing is a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, you absolutely can oversize a mini-split.  And when you do, you end up with some of the same problems you get from oversizing conventional systems:  poor humidity control, short cycling, and wasted money."
